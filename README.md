## A collection of scripts I use

* **Archiving**
    * DownloadDiscordServer: makes a backup of a Discord server with all it's media in the current directory
    * DownloadDiscordDMs: makes a backup of Discord DMs in a folder called "DMs"
    * DownloadYTDL: downloads youtube videos and all their data from a source file

    note: you should either set the $DISCORD_TOKEN variable or replace it with your token ([how to get token](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs))
    note: make sure you change the varibales in DownloadYTDL.sh

* **System**
    * NightMode: lowers the screen brightness to a set value or the argument after the command (NightMode 0.85) and activates redshift
    * DayMode: resets brightness and deactivates redshift
    * StartSetup: my personal start setup on i3
    
* **Requiremnets**
